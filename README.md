# python-products-check-program
This Python script provides a basic command-line interface for managing a simple warehouse of products. It allows users to add products to the warehouse, view the list of available products, and calculate the total price of selected products.

Features:
Add Product: Users can add one or more products to the warehouse by specifying the product name and price.
See Product: Users can view the list of products in the warehouse along with their prices.
Choose: Users can select products from the warehouse and calculate the total price of the selected items.
Exit: Allows users to exit the application.

How to Use:
When the script is run, it presents a menu with options for different actions.
Users can input the number corresponding to their desired action.
For adding products, users can specify the product name and price for each item.
The list of products can be displayed at any time by selecting the "See Product" option.
To calculate the total price of selected products, choose the "Choose" option and input the product names (or "END" to finish).
The script provides feedback on the total price and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
This code serves as a simple starting point for managing a small inventory or warehouse. You can build upon it and add more advanced features as needed.
